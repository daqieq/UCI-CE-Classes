    "Repeat 5.6 by using the dictionary approach: After getting the list from getArtListUserfile, you will create a Python dictionary that will look like the following: artdict = { artist1: 0, artist2: 0, artist3: 0, ..... artistn:0} where n is total number of artists (here zeros depict count initialized to 0s). Next you will read each (let us say ith artist) record in the file user_artist_data.txt and update the count for that particular artist by using code similar to the following:\n",
