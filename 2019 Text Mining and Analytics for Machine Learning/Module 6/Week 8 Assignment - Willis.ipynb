    "# Sentiment and Emotion Analysis of Twitter Feeds - Week 8 Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "I picked the Monero crypto-currency as a topic, and specifically tried to target the Hard Fork that occured on March 9th, 2019. This was a contencious period and I expected to see a lot of emotion in tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The crypto-currency topic on twitter draws a lot of 'spam' tweets that made it difficult to focus on my chosen topic. If I was doing this again, I would spend more time identifying and removing accounts that create spam.  \n",
    "2) The Tweepy API only allowed me to get tweets for the previous week. Ideally, I would have data back into February 2019 to capture more of the lead up to the March 9th date. In the future, I would plan ahead better, or pick a topic that wasn't time constrained.  \n",
    "3) The Twitter API gave me access to the last 30 days of tweets, but it started with the most recent date and only allowed me to pull 18,000 tweets (since I wasted 6,000+ of my monthly quota testing and debugging). In the future, I would have a better tested starting point, or pay for higher quota limits.\n"
